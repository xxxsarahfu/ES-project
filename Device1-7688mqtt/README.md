### Device1-7688mqtt
This is one of the devices in this project - Linkit Smart 7688 Duo by MediaTek + Adxl345 as a sensor node.</br>
* Protocol: MQTT</br>

Since Linkit Samrt 7688 have 2 parts: MCU (compatible with Arduino) & MPU (OpenWrt, Linux), the two files are uploaded to MCU & MPU, respectively. </br>
* a. adxl345.ino: </br>
		-- upload to MCU with Arduino IDE. </br>
		-- get sensor data. </br>
* b. mqtt+mcu2mpu.py: </br>
		-- upload to MPU by OpenWrt. </br>
		-- get data from MCU to MPU, and then send data with MQTT to gateway. </br>
* c. [optional] API_mcu_to_mpu.py:</br>
		-- get sensor data and then directly upload data to cloud platform by API
